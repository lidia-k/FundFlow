I have a PRD and TDD ready for my prototype project. Please help me establish the foundation by:

1.

**Project Structure Setup**

- Review my TDD (attached/pasted below) and create an appropriate directory structure
- Set up organized folders for source code, tests, documentation, and configuration
- Create a clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared components as needed

2.

**Tech Stack Selection & Configuration**

- Based on my technical requirements, recommend and justify the most suitable tech stack
- Set up package managers, build tools, and development environment configuration
- Install and configure essential dependencies and development tools

3.

**Initial Boilerplate Creation**

- Generate starter code templates that align with my architecture design
- Create basic configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, docker files, etc.)
- Set up linting, formatting, and basic testing framework
- Create placeholder files for main application entry points

4.

**Development Environment**

- Set up local development server configuration
- Create necessary environment files and configuration templates
- Add basic scripts for running, building, and testing the application

Please start by analyzing my TDD below and then proceed systematically through each step:

After reviewing the TDD, please ask any clarifying questions about technical preferences or constraints before proceeding with the setup.
