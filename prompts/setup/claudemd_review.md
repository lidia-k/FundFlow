Please review my current claude.md file and suggest improvements based on best practices for working with Claude Code. I want to optimize this file to make our coding sessions as effective as possible.

Review Focus Areas:

1. Content Completeness
- Assess if all necessary project context is included
- Identify any missing information that would help you understand the project better
- Check if technical decisions and constraints are clearly documented

2. Structure & Organization
- Evaluate the current structure for logical flow and readability
- Suggest better section organization if needed
- Recommend additional sections that would be valuable

3. Claude Code Optimization
- Identify what information would make you most effective in coding tasks
- Suggest format improvements for better parsing and understanding
- Recommend any coding standards, preferences, or conventions to document

4. Maintenance & Updates
- Suggest how to keep this file current as development progresses
- Recommend what should be tracked/updated after each major task
- Propose a structure that scales well through development phases

Deliverables:
1. Specific feedback on current content (what's good, what's missing)
2. Suggested improvements with rationale
3. An improved version of the claude.md file
4. Recommendations for keeping it updated during development

Please focus on practical improvements that will make our subsequent coding sessions more efficient and reduce context-setting overhead.
