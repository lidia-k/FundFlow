# Upload API Refactoring - SOLID Architecture Implementation

## Summary
Completed major refactoring of the upload functionality to implement SOLID architecture patterns as specified in CLAUDE.md.

## Key Changes
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Implemented `FileUploadOrchestrator` for complex upload workflow management
- **Factory Pattern**: Added `UploadServiceFactory` for centralized dependency injection
- **Custom Exceptions**: Created hierarchy with `FileValidationException` and `UploadException`
- **SRP Compliance**: Extracted validation logic into dedicated validator classes
- **Column Name Update**: Changed "Distribution Amount" to "Distribution" in Excel parsing (template alignment)
- **Empty Row Handling**: Fixed fund source data parsing to properly handle empty rows

## Architecture Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns with orchestrator pattern
- Easily testable components through dependency injection
- Extensible validation system through validator hierarchy
- Improved error handling with specific exception types
- Maintainable codebase following established patterns

## Files Changed
- `backend/src/api/upload.py` - Simplified to coordination only
- `backend/src/services/excel_service.py` - Column name and empty row fixes
- New orchestrator and factory patterns in services layer
- Updated test files for new column naming convention
