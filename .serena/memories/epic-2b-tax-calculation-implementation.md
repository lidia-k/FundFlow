# Epic 2B: Tax Calculation Implementation

## Overview
Epic 2B extends the SALT rule system to implement automatic tax calculations for investor distributions, moving beyond exemption flags to actual tax computations.

## Key Changes Implemented
- **Data Model Extensions**: Added `composite_tax_amount` and `withholding_tax_amount` fields to Distribution model
- **Tax Calculation Service**: New service implementing 3-step calculation process (exemptions, composite tax, withholding tax)
- **Upload Pipeline Integration**: Tax calculations now run automatically during Excel upload process
- **API Enhancements**: Results API extended to include calculated tax amounts
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for tax calculation logic

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/models/distribution.py` - Added tax amount fields
- `backend/src/services/tax_calculation_service.py` - Core calculation engine (new)
- `backend/src/api/upload.py` - Integrated tax calculations into upload flow
- `backend/src/api/results.py` - Extended to return tax amounts
- `frontend/src/components/FilePreviewModal.tsx` - Clarified exemption headers

## Architecture Integration
- Leverages existing Epic 2A SALT rule infrastructure
- Maintains backward compatibility for sessions without active rule sets
- Follows established service patterns and error handling
- Ready for audit trail implementation in next phase
