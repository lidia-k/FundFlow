# Epic 2A SALT Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete SALT (State and Local Tax) rule management system as part of Epic 2A. This represents a major milestone in the FundFlow project, adding comprehensive tax rule processing capabilities.

## Key Components Implemented

### Database Models (7 new models)
- **SourceFile**: Tracks uploaded Excel files with SHA256 hashing for duplicate detection
- **SaltRuleSet**: Version control for SALT rule collections with lifecycle management
- **WithholdingRule**: Individual withholding tax rules by state and entity type
- **CompositeRule**: Composite tax rates and filing requirements
- **ValidationIssue**: Validation errors and warnings during processing
- **StateEntityTaxRuleResolved**: Denormalized view combining rules for fast calculations

### API Endpoints (6 endpoints)
- `POST /api/salt-rules/upload` - Upload and process SALT rule workbooks
- `GET /api/salt-rules/{id}/validation` - Get validation results (JSON/CSV)
- `GET /api/salt-rules/{id}/preview` - Preview rule changes vs current active
- `POST /api/salt-rules/{id}/publish` - Publish draft rules to active status
- `GET /api/salt-rules` - List rule sets with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/salt-rules/{id}` - Get detailed rule set information

### Services (5 new services)
- **ExcelProcessor**: Parse and validate Excel SALT rule workbooks
- **ValidationService**: Comprehensive validation with error reporting
- **ComparisonService**: Compare rule sets and generate change previews
- **RuleSetService**: Rule set lifecycle and business logic management
- **FileService**: Secure file handling with duplicate detection

### Test Coverage (35 test files)
- **Contract Tests**: API endpoint contract validation (6 files)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing (3 files)
- **Unit Tests**: Individual service and model testing (25 files)
- **E2E Tests**: Performance and complete workflow validation (1 file)

## Technical Achievements

### Data Validation & Security
- SHA256 file hashing for duplicate detection
- Comprehensive Excel format validation
- Secure file storage with path sanitization
- Structured error collection and reporting

### Business Logic
- Rule set lifecycle management (draft → active → archived)
- Conflict detection and resolution workflows
- Change preview generation with detailed comparisons
- Batch rule processing with validation

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints following OpenAPI standards
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Pagination and filtering support
- Multiple response formats (JSON/CSV)

## Testing Strategy
- 100% API contract coverage
- Integration testing for complete workflows
- Unit testing for all services and models
- Performance testing for large rule sets

## Next Steps
This implementation provides the foundation for:
1. Frontend integration with SALT management UI
2. Real-time validation during Excel upload
3. Advanced rule comparison and change tracking
4. Production deployment with proper monitoring

## Files Modified
- 21 new Python files (models, services, API endpoints)
- 35 test files with comprehensive coverage
- Updated enums and database initialization
- Reorganized project documentation structure
