# FundFlow Project Overview

## Project Purpose
FundFlow is an AI-powered automation platform designed to solve manual SALT (State and Local Tax) calculation challenges for Private Equity fund back-office operations. This is a prototype version (v1.2) focused on validating the core workflow of Excel file upload, SALT calculation, and results generation.

**Key Goal**: Validate user experience and data processing workflow with 2-3 test partner clients by Q1 2026.

## Key Features
- **File Upload**: Drag & drop Excel file upload with validation
- **SALT Calculation**: Automated tax calculations using pre-stored EY SALT data
- **Results Dashboard**: Interactive results viewing and management
- **Excel Export**: Download calculation results in Excel format
- **Template System**: Standard portfolio templates for data input
- **User Session Management**: Track uploads and calculations per session

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Tax Directors who need intuitive, fast workflow (e.g., "Sarah Chen")
- **Secondary**: Fund administrators and back-office staff

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: 30min upload-to-results completion time
- **Accuracy**: 95% Excel format recognition accuracy
- **Concurrency**: Support 3-5 concurrent users
- **Processing**: 30min processing for typical files (~10 portfolios, ~20 LPs)
